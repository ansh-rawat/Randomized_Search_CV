# Implementation of Randomized Search Cross Validation from scratch.

Cross validation is done to identify the best hyperparameteres for our machine learning model to get the best results.

In the .ipynb I've made a custom data set and implemented K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. To get the best values of K I've wrote a function that 
gives me the best value of K using the Random Search Cross Validation with customizable folds (without using sklearn of course). Further ploting the results to get the overview.
